I am creating a script that finds and embeds maps into history books. It looks for the name of the map,
then it will embed the map into the epub at the end of the paragraph. I will use openai for my AI, 
googlemaps api for my geocoding and downloading of maps. Various other dependencies will be required,
for chunking text for example. 

1. Import and parse epub file. 
2. Chunk epub file for AI consumption. 
3. AI scans over each chunk of text. It will identify the names of places in a chunk,
interpret them into their modern day equivalents,
then output a normalized list of all places to be depicted on a map.
4. The Normalized locations are then sent to googlemaps API where it will get the image data for the map.
5. The maps will then be embedded into a copy of the epub at the end of the paragraph where the location was mentioned.
